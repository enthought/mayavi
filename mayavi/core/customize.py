""" This module helps customize the mayavi install.  It tries to import
any `site_mayavi.py` (anywhere on `sys.path`) or `user_mayavi.py`.  The
`user_mayavi.py` script is found in the users `~/.mayavi2` directory
and this directory is also injected into the path.

It is the users responsibility to import the mayavi registry
(mayavi.registry:registry) and register any new modules or
filters into mayavi using suitable metadata.

If the user desires to contribute any plugins then they may expose a
function called `get_plugins()` which returns a list of plugins that they
wish to add to the default mayavi envisage app.  The user may expose one
set of global plugins in the `site_mayavi` module and another in the
`user_mayavi` module without any problems.

The function `get_custom_plugins` returns a list of all the available
custom plugins.
