"""An example of how to generate a structured grid dataset using
numpy arrays.  Also shown is a way to visualize this data with
the mayavi2 application.

The script can be run like so::

  $ mayavi2 -x structured_grid.py

Alternatively, it can be run as::

  $ python structured_grid.py

        Parameters
        ----------
        r : array : The radial values of the grid points.
                    It defaults to linspace(1.0, 2.0, 11).

        theta : array : The angular values of the x axis for the grid
                        points. It defaults to linspace(0,2*pi,11).

        z: array : The values along the z axis of the grid points.
                   It defaults to linspace(0,0,1.0, 11).

        ------

            of z and with the inside "ring" of the plane as the first
            set of points.  The default point array will be 1331x3.
