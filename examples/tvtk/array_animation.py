"""A simple example showing an animation.  The example illustrates a
few things.

 1. You can pass a numpy array of scalars and use it directly with
    tvtk.

 2. The tvtk arrays are views of numpy arrays.  Thus changing the
    array in-place will also change the underlying VTK data.

 3. When changing the numpy data you must call `modified` on a
    relevant tvtk object.

The example is a little contrived since there are better ways of
achieving the same effect but the present form nicely illustrates item
2 mentioned above.
