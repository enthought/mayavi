"""Abstracts all VTK related modules into one module.  This makes it trivial to
support local VTK classes that a user may have built.

By default it imports all of VTK and then looks for a tvtk_local module and
imports everything from that.  In order to add local classes to the TVTK build
one may simply provide a tvtk_local.py module somewhere with any classes that
need to be wrapped.
