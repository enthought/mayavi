# wrapper from that.  If the ZIP file is extracted into a tvtk_classes
# directory the ZIP file is not used and the tvtk_classes directory is
# inserted into sys.path and the directory contents are used for the tvtk
# classes -- note that you must have the following structure
# tvtk_classes/tvtk_classes/__init__.py.  This is handy for tools like
# pydev (Eclipse).

# We add the path to the local __path__ here, in the __init__, so that
# the unpickler can directly unpickle the TVTK classes.
